\chapter{Conclusions}

SM is robust at low energy physics but has some issues that may have consequences at the weak scale.
LHC and CMS are powerful machines that can investigate the weak scale.
Performed a pair of searches that are sensitive to pair-produced particles decaying to dark matter, one of these issues, that can constrain SUSY, a solution to the hierarchy problem.
One of these searches targets long-lived particles producing disappearing, a challenging final state to study.
Produced strongest contraints to date.
